# Drowsiness-Detection
This is a simple live stream project which detects your eyes and alerts when the user is drowsy/sleepy. For this project I have used Python with OpenCV and dlib. With help of OpenCV we get the live stream from the camera and using dlib we get the position of eyes and its landmark points. Based on the distance between the landmark points of the users eyes we alert the user.
